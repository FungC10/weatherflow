# WeatherFlow Accessibility Features

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility improvements implemented in WeatherFlow to ensure WCAG AA compliance and excellent keyboard navigation support.

## Keyboard Navigation

### Global Shortcuts
- **`/` key**: Focus the search input from anywhere on the page
- **`Escape` key**: Close dropdowns and return focus to main content

### Search Bar
- **Arrow keys**: Navigate through recent search suggestions
- **Enter**: Select highlighted suggestion or submit search
- **Escape**: Close recent searches dropdown
- **Tab**: Navigate between interactive elements

### Interactive Elements
- All buttons, links, and form controls are fully keyboard accessible
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Logical tab order throughout the application

## ARIA Labels & Semantic HTML

### Form Elements
- Search input has `role="combobox"` with proper ARIA attributes
- Unit toggle has `role="switch"` with aria-checked state
- All form controls have descriptive `aria-label` attributes

### Dynamic Content
- Loading states use `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
- Error messages use `role="alert"` with `aria-live="assertive"`
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

### Lists & Navigation
- Recent searches dropdown uses `role="listbox"` and `role="option"`
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Landmark regions for main content areas

## Visual Accessibility

### Focus Management
- 2px solid cyan focus rings with sufficient contrast
- Focus visible on all interactive elements
- Auto-focus on error states for quick recovery
- Focus returns to search after clearing results

### Color Contrast
- WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for text)
- Slate-900 background (#0f172a) with Slate-100 text (#f1f5f9)
- Cyan-400 (#22d3ee) accent color for high visibility
- Error states use red with sufficient contrast

### Motion & Animation
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- All animations disabled when reduced motion is preferred
- Transition durations set to 0.01ms for reduced motion users
- Subtle scale and shadow effects that enhance without distracting

## Screen Reader Support

### Hidden Content
- `.sr-only` class for screen reader only content
- Descriptive labels for icon-only buttons
- `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative elements
- Help text and instructions for complex interactions

### Live Regions
- Loading messages announced as they appear
- Error messages announced immediately
- Unit changes announced to screen readers
- City selection changes announced

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Keyboard navigation tests for SearchBar
- Focus management verification
- ARIA attribute validation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate entire app using only keyboard
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver)
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode
- [ ] Test with reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Verify color contrast with tools

## Lighthouse Accessibility Score Target
**≥ 95** on desktop

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Future Improvements
1. Add skip navigation links
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts help modal (? key)
3. Add more comprehensive screen reader announcements
4. Support for voice input/output
5. Custom theme support for visual preferences
